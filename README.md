Randomizer - World of Final Fantasy
==================================================================
Mod Created By:	Doicm (decentdoicm)

Special Thanks:	WoFF modding community for tools and information,
various Discord servers for information on advice for programming,
and Surihia for csv/csh conversion tool that this tool uses.

Version: 
==================================================================
0.1.2

Notes:
==================================================================

1.) In order to install and uninstall this, you will need to 
locate your WOFF executable as part of the process.
To find, go to Steam and right-click the game "World of Final
Fantasy, click Manage -> Browse local files.... It should take
you to the folder. 

2.) I highly recommend creating a backup of your primary
save file. You can usually find it on Windows in the following:

&ensp;%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\WOFF\<user-id>\savedata\

or in Linux on the following:

&ensp;<SteamLibrary-folder>/steamapps/compatdata/552700/pfx/

Description:
==================================================================
This mod is designed to work with World of Final Fantasy: Maxima
for Steam. However, it may work without Maxima expansion, but I
have no way of testing it. 

This mod contains treasure chest, random encounter, rare monster,
boss, and mirageboard node shuffle randomization. What else can be
randomized? Not sure yet!

Instructions:
==================================================================
Find the latest release in the releases section on Github, then
download the zip and extract it to a destination of your choosing.
Run WOFFRandomizer.exe and follow the directions for installing. 

If you run into issues with uninstalling, you should be able to 
restore your files by verifying your files on Steam. Hopefully
it won't come to this, but this is just in case.
